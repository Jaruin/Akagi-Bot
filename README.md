# Akagi-Bot
赤木

A Discord bot that runs a game of riichi mahjong.

Akagi-Bot is meant to follow the rules outlined in the [European Mahjong Association's 2016 rulebook](http://mahjong-europe.org/portal/images/docs/Riichi-rules-2016-EN.pdf).  If you notice a discrepancy, please document it and open a Github issue, or better yet fix it and open a pull request.  

WIP.
